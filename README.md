An app in C# used to test one's memory for fun

Note as well that I created the words file by using text mining on the Reuter's corpus. (Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0, at http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/ )  I am only using this words file for research purposes, including (but not limited to) to see what words are displayed, figure out what resources words for this app ought to be drawn from, and to decide what words should go into the app.  I will replace it with words mined from a different source once the app is finished.  Also, with respect to dependencies, I do not recommend grabbing the Mono's dev version of GTK# 3 straight from Mono's github.

Also note:  This code is a work in progress.  The words list has not been vetted for either profanity or obscenity.
